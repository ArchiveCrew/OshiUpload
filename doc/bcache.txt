The best performance experience may be achieved by using an ssd for caching and a hdd for storage in a bcache layer.

Quick setup:
 /dev/sdb = your storage big HDD
 /dev/sda3 = your partition for cache on SSD

sudo dd if=/dev/zero if=/dev/sdb bs=512 count=8
sudo dd if=/dev/zero if=/dev/sda3 bs=512 count=8
wipefs -a /dev/sdb
wipefs -a /dev/sda3

make-bcache -C /dev/sda3 -B /dev/sdb --discard --writeback

Now do `lsblk` and verify your devices are correctly added, also check `dmesg` for possible errors.

Your block device ready to be used as a file storage FS will be on /dev/bcache0
